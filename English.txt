Question 1:

Examples from the poem:

In "Hope" by Emily Dickinson, the speaker describes hope as a "thing with feathers" that "perches in the soul." This metaphor highlights how hope is an intrinsic part of our being, residing within us even during the darkest of times. The speaker also suggests that hope can help sustain us in difficult circumstances, saying that it "never stops at all" and that it can help us weather the toughest of storms.

Another example of the importance of hope in the poem is when the speaker says, "I've heard it in the chillest land, and on the strangest sea." This line suggests that hope can be found in even the most unlikely of places, and that it is a constant companion to those who seek it out.

The thematic statement is supported by these examples from the poem, as they show how hope is a powerful force that can help us endure difficult times. The metaphor of hope as a "thing with feathers" suggests that it is a part of our being, always present and always available to help us through tough times. The image of hope being found in unlikely places reinforces this idea, suggesting that hope can be found even in the darkest and most challenging of circumstances.

Question 2:

Examples from the text:

In All Thirteen, the power of hope is exemplified by the actions of the trapped Thai soccer team and their coach. One example of this is when the boys work together to dig a hole in the cave wall, hoping to find a way out. This act shows how hope can drive individuals to take action, even when the odds are stacked against them. As the book notes, "The boys had hope - and hope made them want to try."

Another example of the power of hope in the text is when the boys hear the sound of rescuers drilling towards them, and they begin to shout and cheer. The book notes that "The boys' voices filled the chamber, echoing off the walls. Hope soared in their chests." This moment highlights how hope can lift us up and sustain us during even the most challenging circumstances, providing the energy and motivation needed to push through and survive.

These examples from All Thirteen illustrate the power of hope in oneself and how it can influence survival. In both cases, the boys are driven to take action and persevere through incredibly difficult circumstances because of their hope for a better outcome. The book suggests that hope can be a powerful survival tool, providing the motivation and drive needed to push through even the most challenging and daunting of situations.
