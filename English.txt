Art plays a crucial role in the lives of Kiko from "Starfish" and Xiomara from "The Poet X." Despite their different forms of art, both characters use it as a tool to express themselves and navigate through their lives. In this essay, I will compare the significance of art in their lives and how it helps them overcome their challenges.

Kiko, the protagonist in "Starfish," uses art to escape the reality of her abusive home life. She finds solace in creating art and loses herself in the process. Kiko's mother, however, does not support her daughter's passion and does not value it. She forces Kiko to pursue a career in science, which creates tension between them. Nonetheless, Kiko finds a way to use her art to express herself and heal from her trauma. Her art becomes her voice, and through it, she finds the courage to confront her abuser and stand up for herself.

On the other hand, Xiomara, the protagonist in "The Poet X," uses her poetry to challenge societal norms and expectations. She lives in a strict and religious household, where her mother tries to control her every move. Xiomara finds it difficult to express her true self in such an environment, but she discovers a form of liberation through her poetry. Her poems address issues such as religion, sexuality, and sexism, and allow her to assert her own beliefs and values. Her poetry becomes a form of resistance against the oppression she experiences at home and at school.

Both Kiko and Xiomara use art as a means of self-expression and empowerment. They both find their voice through their art and use it to address issues that they face in their lives. Although they have different forms of art, their passion for it is equally powerful. Both characters use their art to confront their challenges and gain agency over their lives.

In conclusion, art plays a significant role in the lives of Kiko and Xiomara. It allows them to express themselves and overcome the obstacles they face. Despite their different forms of art, they both use it as a means of self-discovery and empowerment. Through their art, they find their voice and the courage to stand up for themselves.
